# Problem Statement

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. 

 This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. 

Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as : 
* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it? 

#Conclusion



1.   Manhattan and Brooklyn have the highest share of hotels.We deduced this using the pie charts and scatterplots.

2.   Manhattan is the busiest location in New York despite the relative higher cost of living. Availability is the main reason Manhattan is thriving in the airbnb business.Manhattan has the maximum number of listings and is mostly available throughout the year

3.   Manhattan has expensive and Bronx has low priced rooms.But we can see there are more price outliers.We have categorised the rooms into three categories based on price.0-100,100-300 and 300+ as cheap, medium and Expensive rooms.Price range of 0 to 300 is more appealing to the majority of the customers

4.   There is a notable difference in the number of people willing to stay in shared room with respect to a private room or an apartment.Most of the listings are for the stay in an entire apartment


5.   Listings in the less price range seem to have more reviews


6.   calculated_host_listings_count is a very helpful and accurate column of the given dataset.



These conclusions we derived from the analysis of the NYC Airbnb 2019 dataset are very useful for all  the upcoming and current airbnb hosts to start or revamp their business.
